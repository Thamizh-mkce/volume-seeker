# Volume Seeker

This is a simple web application that allows users to control and display the volume level using an interactive slider. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Interactive volume control slider.
- Displays the current volume level as a percentage.
- Updates the displayed volume level dynamically as the slider is adjusted.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the volume control interface.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that styles the volume control slider and text.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the logic for updating the displayed volume level.
